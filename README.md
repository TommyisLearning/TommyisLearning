- 👋 Hi, I’m @TommyisLearning
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use Python3, I am a complete beginner. I am also learning about databases and SQL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about coding and hopefully will actually be able to apply it soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I would also be honored just to watch and learn as I think that is one of the best ways to download information :)
